* Forewords

- repo: https://github.com/Jell/advent2020

- pure SQL, as standard as possible

Some of the solutions could be handled better or more efficiently by creating a function, but functions are not part of the SQL standard.

* Highlights

** Day 1 - part 1

- basic setup
- input from program

** Day 2 - part 1

- lateral select

** Day 10 - part 1

- union
- window function
- filter

** Day 4 - part 1

- with
- window function
- JSON aggregate

** Day 6 - part 2?

- cross join
- having

** Day 7
*** part 1

- step debugging (from (table day07.inputs limit 1 offset 0) i)
- regexp matches
- with recursive

*** part 2

- recursion (iterative reduce)

** Day 8 - part 1

- recursion (interpreter)

** Day 15 - part 1

- hstore (not SQL standard, but JSON too slow!)
- union all

** Day 17 - part 1?

using with in recursion for more complex queries

** Day 19 - part 1?

from tree to largest regexp in the world

** Day 20 - part 2

just pure insanity, why did I even?
